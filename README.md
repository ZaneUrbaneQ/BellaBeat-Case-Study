## Conclusions and Recommendations

Analysis of smart device usage data reveals the following insights:
-  74.3% of awake time users spend in sedentary positions.
-  Very active minutes average only 21-31 minutes daily.
-  The average sleep duration is 7 hours per day.
-  Activity patterns are consistent throughout the weekdays, with Saturday emerging as the most active day and Sunday showing the least activity.
-  Peak steps occur between 17:00 to 19:00 and 12:00 to 14:00..

Recommendations based on the data:
- Devices should minimize manual entries to ensure data accuracy for personalized customer insights.
- Implement reminders for movement, emphasizing precise exercises.
- Include sleep reminders to approach the recommended 8 hours, synchronized with morning alarm times.
- BellaBeat could introduce an educational program coupled with a point-based incentive system.
- Enhance analysis accuracy by expanding participant data, duration, and detailed user information for precise segmentation.
