### Business Task (Ask)
Bellabeat aims to analyze smart device usage data to understand how consumers use their products. This analysis will inform strategic marketing decisions aimed at enhancing user engagement, optimizing product offerings, and expanding market reach.

### About the Data (Prepare)
Data Source: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data from Mobius: https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit

This Kaggle dataset comprises personal fitness tracker data from thirty Fitbit users. These participants consented to provide their personal tracker data, which includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. The dataset features information on daily activity, steps, and heart rate, allowing for an exploration of users' habits. It contains 18 CSV files organized in long format.

ROCCC analysis and dataset limitations:
Reliable: Low - The dataset includes only 30 participants, which is a small sample size and does not accurately represent the broader population of female Fitbit users. This small sample size introduces significant bias and reduces the reliability of any conclusions drawn from the data.
Original: Low — The data being collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk indicates that it is sourced from a third party. 
Comprehensive: Low — The dataset lacks key demographic information such as gender, age, and health conditions. 
Current: Low — The data is approximately 8 years old, having been collected in 2016.
Cited: Low — Data obtained from an unidentified third party (Amazon Mechanical Murk).

## Conclusions and Recommendations (Act)

Analysis of smart device usage data reveals the following insights:
-  74.3% of awake time users spend in sedentary positions.
-  Very active minutes average only 21-31 minutes daily.
-  The average sleep duration is 7 hours per day.
-  Activity patterns are consistent throughout the weekdays, with Saturday emerging as the most active day and Sunday showing the least activity.
-  Peak steps occur between 17:00 to 19:00 and 12:00 to 14:00..

Recommendations based on the data:
- Devices should minimize manual entries to ensure data accuracy for personalized customer insights.
- Implement reminders for movement, emphasizing precise exercises.
- Include sleep reminders to approach the recommended 8 hours, synchronized with morning alarm times.
- BellaBeat could introduce an educational program coupled with a point-based incentive system.
- Enhance analysis accuracy by expanding participant data, duration, and detailed user information for precise segmentation.
